# Jetbrains Academy - Steganography and Cryptography

My solutions for the Jetbrains Academy Problem 'Steganography and Cryptography'

https://hyperskill.org/projects/160

The solution is build up step by step over several stages. 
Stage 1 is the first and simple one. The following stages 
build up on the previous stages and get more and more advanced.
There are four stages in total.

Because each stage is completely independent of the previous one,
IntelliJ might show some warnings about duplicated code between 
the stages.

## Stage 1

[click here to see description @ JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/projects/160/stages/830/implement)

Show the user interface and usage.

just execute this:

    gradle -PmainClass=stage1.MainKt run --console=plain


## Stage 2

[click here to see description @ JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/projects/160/stages/831/implement)

Read and write image files.

just execute this:

    gradle -PmainClass=stage2.MainKt run --console=plain


## Stage 3

[click here to see description @ JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/projects/160/stages/832/implement)

Hide message in image and extract message from image.

just execute this:

    gradle -PmainClass=stage3.MainKt run --console=plain

## Stage 4

[click here to see description @ JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/projects/160/stages/833/implement)

Encrypt message before hiding in image and decrypt after extracting from image.

just execute this:

    gradle -PmainClass=stage4.MainKt run --console=plain
